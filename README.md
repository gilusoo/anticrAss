# anticrAss: A Computational Pipeline for Novel Phage Discovery

The 2014 computational discovery of crAssphage in the human gut sparked the idea that several other undocumented bacteriophages may be living in the same environment undetected. Here, we introduce anticrAss, a pipeline comprised of computational tools to analyze the species composition of metagenomes independent of a reference database.
